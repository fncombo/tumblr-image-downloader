## Contributing
If you would like to contribute, simply fork this repository, work your magic, and submit a pull request. Remember to follow the current style of the code and comment and test it well.

You will need:
* Node.js
* Ruby and Slim

To install all the dependencies, simply run `npm install` in the repository, and you're good to go! You can use `grunt watch` to automatically re-compile the extension every time you make a change, or run either `grunt development` or `grunt production` manually. (The production build is the same as development, except it also minifies all the JavaScript.)

To add the extension to Chrome, go to Settings > Extensions, and open the "extension" folder that is created after you run Grunt.
